    <p>This application showcases the various media player widgets available with the BST Player API to embed multimedia files in
        <a href="http://webtoolkit.googlecode.com">GWT</a> applications. It is a playground of interacting with various audio/video 
        formats using browser plug-ins.</p>

    <h4>Using the application</h4>
    The tab-pane at the bottom of the page contains the Plug-in, Playlist, Player Options and Player Log tabs.  Click any of the
    tabs to expand the pane and click an active tab collapse it.  The tab-pane is active when any of the player widgets is in view.

        Select the desired media player plug-in from the Plug-in tab.  <em>Note: Only plug-ins enabled on the browser are active</em>
    </p>

    <p>Use the <em>Playlist</em> tab to add/remove media URLs to/from the players' playlist.</p>

    <p style="background-image: url('media/player-options.png');background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: bottom center;height: 200px">
        The <em>Player Options</em> tab contains player properties that can be modified in-place. Enable or disable any property to see its effect.
